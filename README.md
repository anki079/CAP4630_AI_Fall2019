# CAP4630: Artificial Intelligence @ UCF (Fall '19)
  + This is a repository for homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course taught at UCF, by Dr Pawel Wocjan in the Fall 2019 semester.

  + The folders for each assignment contain links to the Google colab notebooks for the respective problems.


### Note:
  + Difficulties have been experienced with the rendering of text as links using markdown on GitHub. Thus, the links inside the files on this repository may not be clickable. They are the correct and working URLs nonetheless. 

  + If a link cannot be clicked, please copy and paste the URLs present in the files to your browser's address bar and you will be redirected to the desired colab notebook.
